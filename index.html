                                Hi! I'm Lorena. I am currently a Database Developer who's looking to become a Web Developer.
                                Web development looks like a lot of fun. It allows you to be creative but still requires 
                                logical thinking.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bootcamp has been really enjoyable...so far. I decided to join because I am an former graduate 
                                of UT and know their reputation of having amazing instructors and teaching the latest technology.
                                It is difficult to juggle work, school and life but the end-goal will be worth it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I'm not in class, I enjoy being outdoors. I like to go kayaking, hiking and just jumping
                                into the lake. I'll be spending the rest of the summer outside as often as I can.
                            </p>
