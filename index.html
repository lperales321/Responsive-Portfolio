                            Hi! I'm Lorena. I am currently a Database Developer who's looking to become a Web Developer.
                            Web development looks like a lot of fun. It allows you to be creative but still requires 
                            logical thinking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bootcamp has been really enjoyable...so far. I decided to join because I am an former graduate 
                            of UT and know their reputation of having amazing instructors and teaching the latest technology.
                            It is difficult to juggle work, school and life but the end-goal will be worth it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not in class, I enjoy being outdoors. I like to go kayaking, hiking and just jumping
                            into the lake. I'll be spending the rest of the summer outside as often as I can.
                        </p>
